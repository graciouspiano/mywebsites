<h2>What is Vindinium?</h2>
    <p>Vindinium is an AI based game, where people create and code bots which attempt to reach an objective and win the game. The objective of the game, is to have the most amount of gold in the game once the 1200 turns end. You can get gold by capturing mines, and then keeping them your own for the longest time. </p>
<h2>Well what does your bot do?</h2>
    <p>Well my bot can do many things. First off, my bot can go to unclaimed mines, and claim them. If there are no more unclaimed mines,
    I would go to claimed mines, and steal them. If my health is lower than 25, I would go to a tavern to heal up. I would take two drinks, to fully fill up my health, and then go back to what I was doing. If there is a bot around my bot, and they have lower health than me, go and kill them, so I can get their claimed mines.</p>
    <h2>The Bot</h2>
    <img src="mybotpic.png">
    <p>This is my bot in a game. You get a random ID from 1-4, and a color corresponding to that ID. You can then see your ELO, which is basically the points from all of your wins and losses, and you can see your gold in that current game. That gold goes up every turn according to the mines you own, and then once the game is over if you have most gold, you win. </p>
